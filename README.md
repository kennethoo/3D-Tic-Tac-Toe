# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe
This project was built using HTML, CSS and JS. The difference between the regular Tic Tac toe and the 3D Tic Tac toe is this. 
Here you've got more way to win the intersection combination. 
The rule is simple, it's like a regular tic tac toe, but you win by scoring 3 rows in each table, but also a cross table. 
That means you've got a multiple way to win and lose.
Have fun !!!
